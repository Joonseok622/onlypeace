# Application Blueprint

This project currently serves as a hybrid application with a UI suggesting a "Menu Recommender" but underlying logic generating Lotto numbers.

## Current Features
*   **Header:** Title "오늘 뭐 먹지?" (What to eat today?)
*   **Action:** Button to generate "Menu Recommendations" (which outputs Lotto numbers).
*   **Theme:** Dark mode support.
*   **Display:** Visual "Lotto balls" for results.

## Recent Changes
*   Added `blueprint.md` to track project state.
*   Added a Formspree partnership inquiry form.

## Plan: Add Partnership Inquiry Form
*   **Goal:** Allow users to send partnership inquiries.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Add a `<form>` element to `index.html` targeting `https://formspree.io/f/xjggboll`.
    *   Include fields: Name, Email, Message.
    *   Style the form to match the existing clean, modern aesthetic (with dark mode support).
    *   Ensure the form is responsive and accessible.
