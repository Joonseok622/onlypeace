# Application Blueprint

This project currently serves as a hybrid application with a UI suggesting a "Menu Recommender" but underlying logic generating Lotto numbers.

## Current Features
*   **Header:** Title "오늘 뭐 먹지?" (What to eat today?)
*   **Action:** Button to generate "Menu Recommendations" (which outputs Lotto numbers).
*   **Theme:** Dark mode support.
*   **Display:** Visual "Lotto balls" for results.
*   **Partnership:** Formspree contact form.

## Recent Changes
*   Added `blueprint.md` to track project state.
*   Added a Formspree partnership inquiry form.

## Plan: Add Disqus Comments
*   **Goal:** Allow users to leave comments on the page.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Add the provided Disqus embed code to `index.html` below the partnership form.
    *   Ensure the comments section has appropriate spacing and visual integration.
